                <h1>What is Accounts Receivable (AR) Factoring?</h1>

                <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Accounts receivable factoring is a process that turns your accounts
                  receivables into capital by eliminating the waiting period while your invoices are paid.
                  This process work only for businesses with a business-to-business (B2B) or a
                  business-to-government (B2G) model. <br> <br>

                  This provides businesses with the opportunity to have
                  consistent cash flow for ongoing operations and additional cash reserves to fund
                  growth opportunities. For many businesses, maintaining enough cash can be difficult,
                  especially if a business is young or experiencing rapid growth.<br> <br>

                United Capital Funding provides help to these businesses through AR factoring and we
                can use this process to assess your client's ability to pay (not your ability).
